# I2CIO

The I2CIO library provides an I2CIOServer that enables communicating with external devices over I2C bus.

The I2CIO library provides general-purpose I2CDevice resource that can be used to create a custom Device
profile to communicate with I2C chips that conform to regular address cycle, data cycle communication pattern.
This allows setting up communication with I2C devices without any coding.

The I2CIO library also provides some device-specific pre-made configurations and a custom AD converter component:

LSM9DS1 (Accelerometer,Gyroscope, Magnetometer)

LPS25H (Pressure, Temperature)

HTS221 (Humidity, Temperature)

ADS1115 (4 Analog inputs)
